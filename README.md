# Power BI Report for finding large duplicate files in SharePoint Online

SharePoint sites can quickly become cluttered with duplicate files, taking up valuable storage space and making it difficult to find the information you need.

To help solve this problem, I've created a re-usable Power BI report that searches for duplicates within a single SharePoint site. This report makes it easy to identify and delete unnecessary duplicates, saving you both time and storage space.

## Download the PBIX Report file
[➡️ Download the Duplicate Files.pbix report from here ⬅️](https://github.com/Zerg00s/sp-duplicate-files-report/raw/main/Duplicate%20Files.pbix)

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to download the [.pbix report file](https://github.com/Zerg00s/sp-duplicate-files-report/raw/main/Duplicate%20Files.pbix). Once the file is downloaded, you'll be able to open it in Power BI and update a target SharePoint site.

- Double click on the downloaded .pbix file to open it
- Click on Transform Data
- Then click on Source and update the site URL to point to a site of your choice
- Click on Close an Apply.

- Sign in with your Microsoft account when asked.
- Click on Refresh to refresh the data. 
- Publish the report to a workspace of your choice.

Once the report is published, you'll be able to use the filters provided to search for duplicates by file size and number of duplicates found. You can also view a table of all files, including the file name, size, and full path.

With this report, managing large duplicate files in SharePoint sites has never been easier. Give it a try and see for yourself how much time and storage space you can save.

Happy reporting!
